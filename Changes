Revision history for Sys::Linux::Namespaces

0.016 - June 22 2018
  * Update some documentation because I forgot how this worked

0.015 - May 21 2017
  * Remove a few hacks for signals inside the child that aren't needed since using Linux::Clone instead of unshare only

0.014 - May 21 2017
  * Return the exit code from waitpid so you can see the status of a process

0.013 - May  7 2017
  * Force target mount option to be an absolute path
  * Do kill child subprocess on any signal by default.  This helps prevent zombie PID 1 processes.
  * Switch to an existing implementation of the unshare and clone syscall wrappers.
  * Use the clone syscall instead of unshare+fork when we're running a coderef.  This creates fewer processes, and has better handling of CLONE_NEWPID.
